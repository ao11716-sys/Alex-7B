    <h2><b>Decorating a tree</b></h2>

    <p>One of the most common Xmas<b>(Christmas)</b> traditions is decorating a fir or spruce tree.<br>
People do this because Xmas is originally a Christian tradition celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ the son of God.<br>When decorated the tree symbolizes eternal life, spiritual hope, and family connection.</p>

<h2><b>Exchanging gifts</b></h2>

    <p>Another very common Xmas tradition is exchanging gifts which people do to <i> honor the beleif</i> that the Three Wise Men gave gifts of gold,frankincense and myrrf to Jesus.<br>
However, this is a Christian beleif and for people that aren't Christian there is a different reason as to why they exchange gifts but very vew people that aren't Christian celebrate Christmas.</p>

   <h2><b>Singing carols</b></h2>
   
    <p>An additional Xmas tradition is singing carols.Often sung beetween the 25th of December (Christmas) day and January 5th Christmas carols are sung to tell the story of Nativity,to share the spirit of the holiday, to connect with one another through a shared tradition<br>and to spread joy during the festive season.
It's a great way to start the holidays and get the festive spirit going!</p>

    <h2><b>Hanging stockings</b></h2>

<p>The penultimate tradition of this presentation is hanging stockings peoeple hang stockings because of the legend of St. Nicholas, a generous bishop who secretly dropped bags of gold into the stockings of a poor family to help their three daughters.
The tradition later grew and children started to hang thier own stockings in the hopes of him or Father Christmas to drop gifts in their stocking too.</p>

<h2><b>Leaving carrots and milk for Santa and his 7 reindeer</b></h2>

    <p>The final tradition of the day is leaving carrots and milk for Santa and his 7 reindeer. People do this for Santa as a gesture of gratitude for his hardwork,a way to teach children about giving,and a tradition rooted in historical gift-giving customs.</p>
