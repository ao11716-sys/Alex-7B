    <h2><b>Decorating a tree</b></h2>

    <p>One of the most common Xmas<b>(Christmas)</b> traditions is decorating a fir or spruce tree.<br>
People do this because Xmas is originally a Christian tradition celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ 
        the son of God.<br>When decorated the tree symbolizes eternal life, spiritual hope, and family connection.</p>

<h2><b>Exchanging gifts</b></h2>

    <p>Another very common Xmas tradition is exchanging gifts which people do to <i> honor the beleif</i> that 
        the Three Wise Men gave gifts of gold,frankincense and myrrf to Jesus.<br>
However, this is a Christian beleif and for people that aren't Christian there is a different reason as to 
        why they exchange gifts but very vew people that aren't Christian celebrate Christmas.</p>
