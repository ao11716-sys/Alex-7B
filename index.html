<p>One of the most common Xmas(Christmas) traditions is decorating a fir or spruce tree.<br>
People do this because Xmas is originally a Christian tradition celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ the son of God.<br>When decorated the tree symbolizes eternal life, spiritual hope, and family connection.</p>
